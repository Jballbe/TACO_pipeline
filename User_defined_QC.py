Template file construction for Quality_Criteria_to_apply.py
Each function defined in this file will be applied on each sweep

Each function must be decorated by 
@requires_params(variable_1, variable_2,...)
This decorator ensure that the following function will receive the input variables it needs

Each function parameters must be the same as those entered in @requires_params. The order of appearance doesn't matter
Each function must return 2 object: 
    Obs (str): String defining the test applied
    passed_QC (bool): wether or not the trace should be rejected based on this test

The variables in @requires_params correspond to precise element in the cell or sweep analysis
Here is the exhaustive list of available elements (their type) and: their descritptions

    Bridge_Error_extrapolated (bool): Has the bridge error been determined by extrapolation (True) or directly estimated from the traces(False)
    Bridge_Error_GOhms (float): Bridge Error estimated from the traces
    Cell_Input_Resistance_GOhms (float): Input Resistance of the cell, estimated by averaging the input resistances computed for each sweep
    Cell_Resting_potential_mV (float): Resting potential of the cell, estimated by averaging the resting potentials computed for each sweep
    Cell_Time_constant_ms (float): Time constant of the cell, estimated by averaging the time constants computed for each sweep
    Holding_current_pA (float): Current applied before and after the stimulus application
    Holding_potential_mV (float): Membrane potential resulting of the application of the holding current
    Input_Resistance_GOhms (float): Input Resistance measured in the current sweep
    Raw_current_pA_trace (numpy array of floats) : Trace of the input current applied to the cell
    Raw_potential_mV_trace (numpy array of floats) : Trace of the cell's membrane potential
    Resting_potential_mV (float) : Resting potential of the cell measured in the current sweep
    Sampling_Rate_Hz (float) : Sampling rate of the traces
    SS_potential_mV (float) : Steady state membrane potential, if membrane potential reaches steady state, and do not have spike
    Stim_amp_pA (float) : Difference between the steady state current and the  holding current
    Stim_end_s (float) : Time at which the stimulus current is no longer applied
    Stim_SS_pA (float) : Value of the applied stimulus (between Stim_start_s and Stim_end_s)
    Stim_start_s (float) : Time at which the stimulus current is applied
    Time_constant_ms (float) : Time constant measured in the current sweep
    Time_s_trace (numpy array of floats) :  Time trace of the current sweep
    
    
    
If a Low pass filtered potential of current trace is needed, the parameter name should be written as follow:
    filtered_a_b_c_d
    With :
        a : either "potential" or "current" , indicating if it requires filtered potential trace or filtered current trace
        b : the cutting frequency in kHz as float. Indicate it as 1_0 (1kHz) or 2_3 (2.3kHz) as "." will not be recognized properly
        c : an integer indicating the filter order
        d : either 0 or 1, indicating if the filter should be a zero phase filter (1) or not (0)
    example:
        filtered_potential_5_5_4_0
            Requires potential trace filtered by a non-zero phase Low pass 4th order Butterworth Filter with a cutting frequency of 5.5 kHz
        filtered_current_1_0_2_1
            Requires current trace filtered by a zero phase Low pass 2nd order Butterworth Filter with a cutting frequency of 1 kHz
